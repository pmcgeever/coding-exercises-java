# Intro  
This package contains an example program which finds the sum of all the even values fibinacci numbers who's values are less than 4,000,000

# Exercise  
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:  

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
